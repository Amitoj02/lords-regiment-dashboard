# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Lords Regiment
Dashboard frontend, report it privately so it can be fixed before it is
disclosed:

- **Preferred:** open a [GitHub private security advisory](https://github.com/Amitoj02/lords-regiment-dashboard/security/advisories/new)
  (Security → Advisories → _Report a vulnerability_).
- **Email:** contact@amitoj.dev

Please include a description of the issue and its impact, steps to reproduce
(a proof of concept if you have one), the affected version / commit, and any
suggested remediation.

We aim to acknowledge a report within **72 hours** and to provide a remediation
timeline after triage. Please give us a reasonable window to release a fix
before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This repository is the Angular single-page frontend. The REST API backend lives
in a separate repository (`lords-dashboard-backend`); vulnerabilities there
should be reported through that repository's security policy.

Out of scope: self-XSS, missing best-practice headers with no demonstrated
impact, and reports generated solely by automated scanners without a working
proof of concept.

## Supported versions

This project is deployed continuously from `main`. Only the latest `main` is
supported; fixes are not backported.
